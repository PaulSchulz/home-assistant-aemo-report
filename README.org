#+TITLE: AEMO Report

[[file:images/national-energy-market.png]]

* Introduction

This Home Assistant Integration retrieves data from the National Energy
Market (NEM) in Australia.

This integration uses the official API to get the the current report on the
status of the Electricity Grid on the east coast of Australia, including South
Australia. This report is available from
https://visualisations.aemo.com.au/aemo/apps/api/report/ELEC_NEM_SUMMARY

Specifically, the report contains the current energy pricing in the various
submarkets, and the production and consumption values and any network notices
which are currently active.

* Status

The initial (and current) development uses existing Home Assistant integrations
(RESTful and Template) to poll the API for the report, import and process the
data and create entities for monitoring and displaying the data.

** Installation
Copy the configuration file (config/aemo_report.yaml) into your Home Assistant
configuration file. (The file access tool add-on be required to do this.)

A dashboard definition file which has some suitable cards already defined can be
found in 'dashboards/', with individual cards defined in 'cards/'.

** Current Issues and Future Development

- The import of the various State(Market) parameters explicitly depends on the
  order listed int he JSON report. If this order ever changes, the data will be
  incorrectly reported.

- The JSON report contains more information (eg. Network Notices, Interconnector
  Power Transfers). It would be good to display more of these details.

- Further development of this configuration into an integration (AEMO Report)
  which can be easily installed without manually editing YAML files.

* Notes
*** Summary of the Report extraction 
On a Linux host, the AEMO JSON report can be downloaded with the following
command (if you have *wget* and *jq* installed):

#+begin_src sh
  wget https://visualisations.aemo.com.au/aemo/apps/api/report/ELEC_NEM_SUMMARY -O - \
    | jq

    wget https://visualisations.aemo.com.au/aemo/apps/api/report/ELEC_NEM_SUMMARY -O - \
    | jq > ELEC_NEM_SUMMARY.json
#+end_src

The summary report looks something like the following, where the first element
of the arrays is shown.
